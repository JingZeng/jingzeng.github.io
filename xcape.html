<h4>DESIGN BRIEF</h4>
<p>We were challenged to design an interactive VR app using Google Cardboard. The VR experience needs to have positive impacts on people's wellbeing. </p>
<br>
<h4>OUR SOLUTION</h4>
<p>XCAPE is a VR escape training prototype, aiming to improve player's escaping skills in various dangerous situations. While the demo scene is about escaping from a fire accident, our whole VR app is designed to include various dangerous situations, such as fire, earthquake, terrorist attack, etc. We focused our design on building an immersive experience as well as teaching practical escaping skills.</p>
<br>
<h4>DESIGN TEAM</h4>
<p>I collaborated with two design students on this project. My role was developer and UX designer.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4 text-center"> 
<h5>Variation</h5>
<p>We aim to design a comprehensive disaster /escaping training simulator. In addition to the various dangerous situations, under each case, player can also choose different modes, such as single player, play with others (with other virtual roles to help you learn how to escape with other people). Under some modes, the players can also choose their character group such as single, with friends or with family, as it can be an important factor influencing their escaping capability.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4 text-center"> 
<h5>Education</h5>
<p>The educational purpose is reflected by providing escape knowledge and tips throughout the game. For example, when players collect a key object, a pop-up window will suggest different usages of the item. Players can make decision by choosing the action. If the players make a wrong choice or put themselves in a dangerous situation, they will get notification. At the end of the game, player can view the summary of their choices and learn about the right decision.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4 text-center"> 
<h5>Gamification</h5>
<p>In order to attract the players, we tried to incorporate game elements into this VR training simulator. For example, we set levels for them and when they pass a new level they will get a reward (an extra survive chance in another game level). Also, the game is  time limited as the playâ€™s HP bar is connected to time and other factors.</p><br>

<p>Our VR app is different from other apps on the current market. Compared with other escaping training apps and websites, our design offers an immersive experience with virtual reality. This will best simulate the dangerous situation with relatively low costs. Although there are a few VR apps which also offer disaster simulation experience, most of them require devices like HTC Vive or Oculus. Our app is based on cardboard, which is far more affordable. Therefore, it has the potential to reach larger population and bring escape skills to more people. </p>
<p>
In terms of design, most similar apps only focus on providing game experience rather than educating or training. They offer only one dangerous situation to play with. In contrast, our app aim to offer a wide range of situations and provide tips through playing. </p>

	  <h3>Reflection</h3>
<h5>Things that Worked in our Design</h5>
<p>The fundamental elements of our design worked. This includes our model room and the basic interactions. With 3ds Max and Unity, we build a model room where the player can walk around and interact with the stuff inside the room. The player can pick up an object
by gazing at it for 1.5 seconds. Walking is achieved by press the button on the Cardboard. If the player tap the button once, he will head forward automatically until he tap the button again. Currently, the players can interact with a few objects in the room. For example, he can open the door by gazing the handle on the door. Moreover, he can pick up a mobile phone to call the fire police or pick up a wet cloth to cover his mouth and nose in the smoke.</p><br>

<h5>Things that did not Work</h5>
<p>However, there are some details which did not work mostly because of technical issues. For example, when the players interact with an object, there is supposed to appear a pop-up window with different choice for them to choose from. However, our current version only has information in the pop-up box. Due to time and competence limit, we tried but unfortunately still not able to work out this interaction. Another important design which we did not work out is the HP bar and the algorithm in the backend. Without incorporating all the win/lose conditions and judgements in the system, our prototype can only be used for demonstration purpose at this stage.</p>
